    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's interesting to see how temperatures for each city change over timeâ€”looking at every month results in a big table, which can be tricky to reason about. Instead, let's look at how temperatures change by year.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the components of a date (year, month and day) using code of the form dataframe[\"column\"].dt.component. For example, the month component is dataframe[\"column\"].dt.month, and the year component is dataframe[\"column\"].dt.year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the year column, you can create a pivot table with the data aggregated by city and year, which you'll explore in the coming exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is loaded as pd. temperatures is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a year column to temperatures, from the year component of the date column.\n",
    "- Make a pivot table of the avg_temp_c column, with country and city as rows, and year as columns. Assign to temp_by_country_city_vs_year, and look at the result.\n"
