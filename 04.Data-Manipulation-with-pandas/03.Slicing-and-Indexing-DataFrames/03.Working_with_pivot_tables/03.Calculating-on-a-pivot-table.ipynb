    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pivot tables are filled with summary statistics, but they are only a first step to finding something insightful. Often you'll need to perform further calculations on them. A common thing to do is to find the rows or columns where the highest or lowest value occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from Chapter 1 that you can easily subset a Series or DataFrame to find rows of interest using a logical condition inside of square brackets. For example: series[series > value].\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is loaded as pd and the DataFrame temp_by_country_city_vs_year is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate the mean temperature for each year, assigning to mean_temp_by_year.\n",
    "- Filter mean_temp_by_year for the year that had the highest mean temperature.\n",
    "- Calculate the mean temperature for each city (across columns), assigning to mean_temp_by_city.\n",
    "- Filter mean_temp_by_city for the city that had the lowest mean temperature.\n"
