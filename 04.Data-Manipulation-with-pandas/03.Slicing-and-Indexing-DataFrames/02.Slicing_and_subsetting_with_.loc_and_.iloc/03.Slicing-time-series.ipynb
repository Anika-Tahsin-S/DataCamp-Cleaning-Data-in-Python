    "### Slicing time series\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing is particularly useful for time series since it's a common thing to want to filter for data within a date range. Add the date column to the index, then use .loc[] to perform the subsetting. The important thing to remember is to keep your dates in ISO 8601 format, that is, \"yyyy-mm-dd\" for year-month-day, \"yyyy-mm\" for year-month, and \"yyyy\" for year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from Chapter 1 that you can combine multiple Boolean conditions using logical operators, such as &. To do so in one line of code, you'll need to add parentheses () around each condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is loaded as pd and temperatures, with no index, is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Boolean conditions, not .isin() or .loc[], and the full date \"yyyy-mm-dd\", to subset temperatures for rows in 2010 and 2011 and print the results.\n",
    "- Set the index of temperatures to the date column and sort it.\n",
    "- Use .loc[] to subset temperatures_ind for rows in 2010 and 2011.\n",
    "- Use .loc[] to subset temperatures_ind for rows from Aug 2010 to Feb 2011.\n"
