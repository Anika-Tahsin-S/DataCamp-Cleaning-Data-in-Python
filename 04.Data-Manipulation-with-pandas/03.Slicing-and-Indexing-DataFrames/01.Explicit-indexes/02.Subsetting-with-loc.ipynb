    "\n",
    "The killer feature for indexes is .loc[]: a subsetting method that accepts index values. When you pass it a single argument, it will take a subset of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for subsetting using .loc[] can be easier to read than standard square bracket subsetting, which can make your code less burdensome to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas is loaded as pd. temperatures and temperatures_ind are available; the latter is indexed by city.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a list called cities that contains \"Moscow\" and \"Saint Petersburg\".\n",
    "- Use [] subsetting to filter temperatures for rows where the city column takes a value in the cities list.\n",
    "- Use .loc[] subsetting to filter temperatures_ind for rows where the city is in the cities list.\n"
