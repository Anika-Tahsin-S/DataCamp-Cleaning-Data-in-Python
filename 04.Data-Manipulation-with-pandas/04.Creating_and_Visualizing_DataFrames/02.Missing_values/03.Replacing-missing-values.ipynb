    "Another way of handling missing values is to replace them all with the same value. For numerical variables, one option is to replace values with 0â€” you'll do this here. However, when you replace missing values, you make assumptions about what a missing value means. In this case, you will assume that a missing number sold means that no sales for that avocado type were made that week.\n",
