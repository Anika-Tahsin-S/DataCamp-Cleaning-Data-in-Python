    "Sometimes, data sources can be so large in size that storing the entire dataset in memory becomes too resource-intensive. In this exercise, you will process the first 1000 rows of a file line by line, to create a dictionary of the counts of how many times each country appears in a column in the dataset.\n",

    "The csv file 'world_dev_ind.csv' is in your current directory for your use. To begin, you need to open a connection to this file using what is known as a context manager. For example, the command with open('datacamp.csv') as datacamp binds the csv file 'datacamp.csv' as datacamp in the context manager. Here, the with statement is the context manager, and its purpose is to ensure that resources are efficiently allocated when opening a connection to a file.\n",
