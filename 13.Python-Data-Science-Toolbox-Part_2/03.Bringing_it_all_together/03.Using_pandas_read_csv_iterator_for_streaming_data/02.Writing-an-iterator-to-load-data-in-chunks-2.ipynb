    "In the previous exercise, you used read_csv() to read in DataFrame chunks from a large dataset. In this exercise, you will read in a file using a bigger DataFrame chunk size and then process the data from the first chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "To process the data, you will create another DataFrame composed of only the rows from a specific country. You will then zip together two of the columns from the new DataFrame, 'Total Population' and 'Urban population (% of total)'. Finally, you will create a list of tuples from the zip object, where each tuple is composed of a value from each of the two columns mentioned.\n",
