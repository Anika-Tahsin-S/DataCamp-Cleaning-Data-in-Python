    "### Using a list comprehension\n",
    "This time, you're going to use the lists2dict() function you defined in the last exercise to turn a bunch of lists into a list of dictionaries with the help of a list comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lists2dict() function has already been preloaded, together with a couple of lists, feature_names and row_lists. feature_names contains the header names of the World Bank dataset and row_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist is a list of actual values of a row from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to use a list comprehension to generate a list of dicts, where the keys are the header names and the values are the row entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inspect the contents of row_lists by printing the first two lists in row_lists.\n",
    "- Create a list comprehension that generates a dictionary using lists2dict() for each sublist in row_lists. The keys are from the feature_names list and the values are the row entries in row_lists. Use sublist as your iterator variable and assign the resulting list of dictionaries to list_of_dicts.\n",
    "- Look at the first two dictionaries in list_of_dicts by printing them out.\n",
