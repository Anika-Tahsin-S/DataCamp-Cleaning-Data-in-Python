    "That is a radical read-only context manager! Now you can relax, knowing that every time you use with open_read_only() your files are safe from being accidentally overwritten. This function is an example of a context manager that _does_ return a value, so we write yield read_only_file instead of just yield. Then the read_only_file object gets assigned to my_file in the with statement so that whoever is using your context can call its .read() method in the context block."
