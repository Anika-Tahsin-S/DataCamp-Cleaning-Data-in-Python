    "### Measuring decorator overhead\n",
    "Your boss wrote a decorator called check_everything() that they think is amazing, and they are insisting you use it on your function. However, you've noticed that when you use it to decorate your functions, it makes them run much slower. You need to convince your boss that the decorator is adding too much processing time to your function. To do this, you are going to measure how long the decorated function takes to run and compare it to how long the undecorated function would have taken to run. This is the decorator in question:"
