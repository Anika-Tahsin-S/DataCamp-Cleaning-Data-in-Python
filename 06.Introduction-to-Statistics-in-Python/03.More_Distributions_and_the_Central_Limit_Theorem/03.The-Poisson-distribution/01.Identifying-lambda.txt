### Identifying lambda

Now that you've learned about the Poisson distribution, you know that its shape is described by a value called lambda. In this exercise, you'll match histograms to lambda values.

Match each Poisson distribution to its lambda value.

# lambda = 1
- highest probabilities at 0 and 1

# lambda = 4
- highest probabilities at 3 and 4

# lambda = 8
- highest probabilities at 7 and 8

The Poisson distribution is a family of distributions, just like the uniform, binomial, or normal distributions.
