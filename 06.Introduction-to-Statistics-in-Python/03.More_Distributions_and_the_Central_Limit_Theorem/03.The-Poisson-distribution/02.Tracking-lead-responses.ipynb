    "### Tracking lead responses\n",
    "Your company uses sales software to keep track of new sales leads. It organizes them into a queue so that anyone can follow up on one when they have a bit of free time. Since the number of lead responses is a countable outcome over a period of time, this scenario corresponds to a Poisson distribution. On average, Amir responds to 4 leads each day. In this exercise, you'll calculate probabilities of Amir responding to different numbers of leads."
