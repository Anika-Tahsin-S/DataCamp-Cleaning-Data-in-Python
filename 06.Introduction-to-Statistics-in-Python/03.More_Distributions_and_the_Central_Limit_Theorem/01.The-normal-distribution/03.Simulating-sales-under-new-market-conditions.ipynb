    "### Simulating sales under new market conditions\n",
    "The company's financial analyst is predicting that next quarter, the worth of each sale will increase by 20% and the volatility, or standard deviation, of each sale's worth will increase by 30%. To see what Amir's sales might look like next quarter under these new market conditions, you'll simulate new sales amounts using the normal distribution and store these in the new_sales DataFrame, which has already been created for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, norm from scipy.stats, pandas as pd, and matplotlib.pyplot as plt are loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Currently, Amir's average sale amount is $5000. Calculate what his new average amount will be if it increases by 20% and store this in new_mean.\n",
    "- Amir's current standard deviation is $2000. Calculate what his new standard deviation will be if it increases by 30% and store this in new_sd.\n",
    "- Create a variable called new_sales, which contains 36 simulated amounts from a normal distribution with a mean of new_mean and a standard deviation of new_sd.\n",
    "- Plot the distribution of the new_sales amounts using a histogram and show the plot."
