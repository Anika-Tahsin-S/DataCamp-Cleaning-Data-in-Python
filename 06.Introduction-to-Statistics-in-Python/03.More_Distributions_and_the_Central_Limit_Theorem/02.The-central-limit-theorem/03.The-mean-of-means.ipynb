    "You want to know what the average number of users (num_users) is per deal, but you want to know this number for the entire company so that you can see if Amir's deals have more or fewer users than the company's average deal. The problem is that over the past year, the company has worked on more than ten thousand deals, so it's not realistic to compile all the data. Instead, you'll estimate the mean by taking several random samples of deals, since this is much easier than collecting data from everyone in the company.\n",
