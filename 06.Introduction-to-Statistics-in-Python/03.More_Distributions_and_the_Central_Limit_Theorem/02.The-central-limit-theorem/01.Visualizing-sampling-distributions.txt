Visualizing sampling distributions

On the right, try creating sampling distributions of different summary statistics from samples of different distributions. Which distribution does the central limit theorem not apply to?

a) Discrete uniform distribution
b) Continuous uniform distribution
c) Binomial distribution
d) All of the above
e) None of the above

Answer: e
Victorious visualizing! Regardless of the shape of the distribution you're taking sample means from, the central limit theorem will apply if the sampling distribution contains enough sample means.
