In the video, you learned about two different ways of taking samples: with replacement and without replacement. 
Although it isn't always easy to tell which best fits various situations, it's important to correctly identify this so that any probabilities you report are accurate. 
In this exercise, you'll put your new knowledge to the test and practice figuring this out.

For each scenario, decide whether it's sampling with replacement or sampling without replacement.

# With replacement
a) Rolling a die twice
b) Flipping a coin 3 times

# Without replacement
a) From a deck of cards, dealing 3 players 7 cards each
b) Randomly selecting 5 products from the assembly line to test for qualoty assurance
c) Randomly picking 3 people to work on the weekend from a group of 20 people

Radical replacement judgment! 
Correctly identifying the type of sampling that needs to be used is key to calculating accurate probabilities. 
With replacement, everyone always has a 5% chance of working on the weekend. 
Without replacement, the second pick has a 4/19 chance, and the third pick has a 3/18 chance of working on the weekend.
