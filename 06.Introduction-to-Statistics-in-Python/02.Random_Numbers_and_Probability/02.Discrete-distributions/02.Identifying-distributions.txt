Identifying distributions

Which sample is most likely to have been taken from a uniform distribution?

Answer: B 
Impressive identification! Since the histogram depicts a sample and not the actual probability distribution, 
each outcome won't happen the exact same number of times due to randomness, but they're similar in number.
