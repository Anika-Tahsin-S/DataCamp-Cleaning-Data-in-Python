Which distribution?

At this point, you've learned about the two different variants of the uniform distribution: the discrete uniform distribution, and the continuous uniform distribution. In this exercise, you'll decide which situations follow which distribution.

Illustration of discrete and continuous uniform distributions

Map each situation to the probability distribution it would best be modeled by.

# Discrete uniform
a) The ticket number of a raffle winner, assuming there is one ticket for each number from 1 to 100.
b) The outcome of rolling a 4-sided die.

# Continuous uniform
a) The time of day a baby will be born
b) The time you'll have to wait for a geyser to erupt if you show up at a random time, knowing that the geyser erupts exactly every ten minutes.

# Other
a) The height of a random person.
