### Longitudinal vs. cross-sectional studies

A company manufactures thermometers, and they want to study the relationship between a thermometer's age and its accuracy. To do this, they take a sample of 100 different thermometers of different ages and test how accurate they are. Is this data longitudinal or cross-sectional?

Answer the question
a) Longitudinal
b) Cross-sectional
c) Both
d) Neither

Answer: B
This is a cross-sectional study since researchers aren't following the same set of thermometers over time and repeatedly measuring their accuracy at different ages.
