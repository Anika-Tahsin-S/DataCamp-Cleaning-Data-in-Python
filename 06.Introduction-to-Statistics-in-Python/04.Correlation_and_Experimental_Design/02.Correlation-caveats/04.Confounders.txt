A study is investigating the relationship between neighborhood residence and lung capacity. 
Researchers measure the lung capacity of thirty people from neighborhood A, which is located near a highway, and thirty people from neighborhood B, which is not near a highway. 
Both groups have similar smoking habits and a similar gender breakdown.

Which of the following could be a confounder in this study?
