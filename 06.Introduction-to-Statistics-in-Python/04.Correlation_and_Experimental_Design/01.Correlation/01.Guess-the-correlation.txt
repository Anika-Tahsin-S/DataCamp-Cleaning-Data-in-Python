### Guess the correlation
On the right, use the scatterplot to estimate what the correlation is between the variables x and y. Once you've guessed it correctly, use the New Plot button to try out a few more scatterplots. When you're ready, answer the question below to continue to the next exercise.

Which of the following statements is NOT true about correlation?

a) If the correlation between x and y has a high magnitude, the data points will be clustered closely around a line.
b) Correlation can be written as r.
c) If x and y are negatively correlated, values of y decrease as values of x increase.
d) Correlation cannot be 0.

Answer: d
Spot on! When correlation is 0, that means there is no relationship between two variables and the points appear to be randomly scattered.
