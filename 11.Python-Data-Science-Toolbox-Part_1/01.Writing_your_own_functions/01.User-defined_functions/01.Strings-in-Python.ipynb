    "### Strings in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video, you learned of another standard Python datatype, strings. Recall that these represent textual data. To assign the string 'DataCamp' to a variable company, you execute:\n",
    "\n",
    "company = 'DataCamp'\n",
    "\n",
    "You've also learned to use the operations + and * with strings. Unlike with numeric types such as ints and floats, the + operator concatenates strings together, while the * concatenates multiple copies of a string together. In this exercise, you will use the + and * operations on strings to answer the question below. Execute the following code in the shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "object1 = \"data\" + \"analysis\" + \"visualization\"\n",
    "object2 = 1 * 3\n",
    "object3 = \"1\" * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the values in object1, object2, and object3, respectively?"
