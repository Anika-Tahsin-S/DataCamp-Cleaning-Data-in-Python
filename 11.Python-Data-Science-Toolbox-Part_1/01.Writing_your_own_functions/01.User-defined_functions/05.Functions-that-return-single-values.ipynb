    "Another modification to the shout() function so that it now returns a single value instead of printing within the function. Recall that the return keyword lets you return values from functions. Parts of the function shout(), which you wrote earlier, are shown. Returning values is generally more desirable than printing them out because, as you saw earlier, a print() call assigned to a variable has type NoneType.\n",

    "- In the function body, concatenate the string in word with '!!!' and assign to shout_word.\n",

    "- Call the shout() function, passing to it the string, 'congratulations', and assigning the call to the variable, yell.\n",
    "- To check if yell contains the value returned by shout(), print the value of yell.\n"
