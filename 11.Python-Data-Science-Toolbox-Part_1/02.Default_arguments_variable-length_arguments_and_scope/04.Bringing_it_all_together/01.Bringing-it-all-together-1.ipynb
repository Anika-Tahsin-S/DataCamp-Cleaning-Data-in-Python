    "### Bringing it all together (1)\n",
    "Recall the Bringing it all together exercise in the previous chapter where you did a simple Twitter analysis by developing a function that counts how many tweets are in certain languages. The output of your function was a dictionary that had the language as the keys and the counts of tweets in that language as the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will generalize the Twitter language analysis that you did in the previous chapter. You will do that by including a default argument that takes a column name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience, pandas has been imported as pd and the 'tweets.csv' file has been imported into the DataFrame tweets_df. Parts of the code from your previous work are also provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete the function header by supplying the parameter for a DataFrame df and the parameter col_name with a default value of 'lang' for the DataFrame column name.\n",
    "- Call count_entries() by passing the tweets_df DataFrame and the column name 'lang'. Assign the result to result1. Note that since 'lang' is the default value of the col_name parameter, you don't have to specify it here.\n",
    "- Call count_entries() by passing the tweets_df DataFrame and the column name 'source'. Assign the result to result2.\n",
