    "### Functions with variable-length keyword arguments (**kwargs)\n",
    "Let's push further on what you've learned about flexible arguments - you've used *args, you're now going to use **kwargs! What makes **kwargs different is that it allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to functions. Recall from the previous video that, within the function definition, kwargs is a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this idea better, you're going to use **kwargs in this exercise to define a function that accepts a variable number of keyword arguments. The function simulates a simple status report system that prints out the status of a character in a movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete the function header with the function name report_status. It accepts a single flexible argument **kwargs.\n",
    "- Iterate over the key-value pairs of kwargs to print out the keys and values, separated by a colon ':'.\n",
    "- In the first call to report_status(), pass the following keyword-value pairs: name=\"luke\", affiliation=\"jedi\" and status=\"missing\".\n",
    "- In the second call to report_status(), pass the following keyword-value pairs: name=\"anakin\", affiliation=\"sith lord\" and status=\"deceased\".\n",
