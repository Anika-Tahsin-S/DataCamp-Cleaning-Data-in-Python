    "### Error handling by raising an error\n",
    "Another way to raise an error is by using raise. In this exercise, you will add a raise statement to the shout_echo() function you defined before to raise an error message when the value supplied by the user to the echo argument is less than 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "The call to shout_echo() uses valid argument values. To test and see how the raise statement works, simply change the value for the echo argument to a negative value. Don't forget to change it back to valid values to move on to the next exercise!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete the if statement by checking if the value of echo is less than 0.\n",
    "- In the body of the if statement, add a raise statement that raises a ValueError with message 'echo must be greater than or equal to 0' when the value supplied by the user to echo is less than 0."
